(Human) History of Project
--------------------------

This video game was started on September 16, 2018. Additionally, I followed a
tutorial by Brackeys, which you can find here:

In case it is needed, the title of the playlist is "How to make a Video Game",
and its first video is called "How to make a Video Game - Getting Started" and
was uploaded on January 22, 2017.

In essence, this is a practice video game. I just wanna complete a video game
with the Unity game engine. If I like it, I'll continue. Simple as that.
